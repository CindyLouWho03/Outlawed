As you feel asleep that one night, you had a dream. A Horrible dream, where you were transported to another land. In this land Electricity doesn't exist, and all of your technological needs to be simulated with magic. Quests will guide you using the magical energy to simulate the technology around you.

This pack "Will" uses tons of custom recipes, and may as well be considered an "Expert" modpack.

If you don't know what that is, it means that its harder through recipe manipulation. This form of the expert pack is the make the user go through each mod using its item to start the next mods. This isn't a strict progression meaning you will finish the pack at the same time of finishing all the mods.

This modpack is aimed to progress the user through magical based mods, to get into to technological variants. Keep note this isn't final yet but this is my end goal for this pack.
